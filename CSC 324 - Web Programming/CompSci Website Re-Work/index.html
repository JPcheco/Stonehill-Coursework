            <h3> Computer science -- what is it? </h3>
            <p>
                Computer science is a discipline that involves the understanding and design of computers and computational processes. Particular interest is 
                placed on making processes efficient and endowing them with some form of intelligence. The discipline ranges from theoretical studies of 
                algorithms to practical problems of implementation in terms of computational hardware and software....In computer science there is an inherent 
                intermingling of the theoretical concepts of computability and algorithmic efficiency with the modern practical advancements in electronics 
                that continue to stimulate advances in the discipline. It is this close interaction of the theoretical and design aspects of the field that 
                binds them together into a single discipline.

            <h1> Computer science at Stonehill -- what is it? </h1>
            <p> Here, we have two definitions of computer science: one somewhat technical, the other quite simple. Nonetheless, both emphasize theoretical foundations coupled with hardware and software design.  The curriculum at Stonehill reflects this blend of theory and practice. At Stonehill, computer science courses fall roughly into three overlapping categories: computer theory, computer architecture (hardware), and computer software. <br><br>

                Courses in computer theory provide the foundation for tomorrow's technology.  Under the rubric of theory, students study theoretical topics like " computability," "finite state machines," and "graph theory"  as well as the design and analysis of algorithms. <br><br>

                The architecture sequence consists of several courses which explore the computer "under the hood."  In one such course, students design their own small computers using a bit of mathematical theory.  Architecture courses allow students to understand computer  hardware from both the engineer's and the programmer's point of view. <br><br>

                The software component of the curriculum  begins with elementary computer  programming and progresses to more advanced topics like database management systems, artificial intelligence, and operating systems.  In the final capstone course, seniors, working in  teams, develop large software systems using the principles of  software engineering. <br><br>

                Through problem solving and lab work, computer science majors develop an understanding of each of these subject areas as well as the strong relationships among them.  This balanced mix of theory and application, provides graduates with the requisite background for both entry into the computer profession and further graduate study in computer science.
