                <div class="answer">
                    Many computer science majors choose to complete an internship during the junior or senior year. During the semester, a student will  
                    typically work eight to twelve hours per week at a local company such as General Dynamics, Shields MRI, Staples, or Intersystems.   
                    Students not only gain "real world" experience but also receive academic credit. Students also have the opportunity to complete summer 
                    internships for academic credit. <br><br>

                    Here are some comments from a few Stonehill computer science interns: <br><br>

                    "The internship and project have been a great learning experience for me. Not only did I learn how to work as a team member on a project, 
                    but I was actually one of the leaders...  I am very anxious to see the release of the project because I have worked on it from the 
                    planning stage and I am very proud of it." <br><br>

                    "One of the more exciting experiences I have had during my internship was the opportunity to write code for a cable modem diagnostic 
                    application called StormWatch. [My internship] provided me with valuable experience while at the same time giving me a chance to work 
                    with new technology." <br><br>

                    "My internship helped me to understand what I really want to do when I graduate -- become a software engineer... I'd like  
                    to develop software that somehow helps people and makes a difference." <br><br>

                    "This internship was very important in terms of building my confidence as a software engineer. I feel that if I could do well at KoolConnect, 
                    with all of the various tools, environments and languages I needed to learn, I can do well anywhere. I also feel like I learned a little bit 
                    about the actual business world. The biggest thing I will take from the whole experience is an increased confidence in my skills as a programmer 
                    and increased confidence in my ability to work well on my own." <br><br>
