                <div class="question">
                    I really like computers, but I'm not quite sure about computer science. 
                    What kind of things will I learn in computer science?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    That's a pretty complicated question which deserves more than a brief response. Nonetheless, here's a condensed view of computer science at Stonehill.<br>
                    Computer science courses fall roughly into four (overlapping) categories : theory, architecture, systems software, and applications. <br><br>

                    In one particular theory course ( Theory of Computation ) you may discuss the limits of computation ("What problems <b>cannot</b>  be solved on a computer?") while 
                    in the <i>Algorithms</i> course you may write a program to find the shortest route between, say, New York and Los Angeles and then <i>prove</i> that you your solution is correct. 
                    In the <i>Compiler Design</i> course you will even learn how to design and implement your own homemade programming language. <br><br>

                    In the architecture sequence you will explore the computer "under the hood." In <i>Computer Logic and Organization</i>, you will design a small computer on paper and, 
                    later, in <i>Microcomputer Electronics</i> build your computer in the lab where you will see your logic come to life. <br><br>

                    The systems software group includes courses like <i>Operating Systems</i> where you'll learn how an operating system like Windows or UNIX is constructed. 
                    Rounding out the curriculum is a number of applications courses like <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> where you will understand how a computer can play chess 
                    and even write a few games of your own or <i>Data Structures</i> where you may design a computer simulation to determine how many runways should be built 
                    for a community airport. <br><br>

                    Of course, you will first learn how to write computer programs. To this end, all freshmen currently learn the programming language Java in their first year 
                    at Stonehill. In addition to formal courses, most students do internship work in their junior or senior years. <br><br>

                    The professional organization of computer scientists, The ACM can give you more detailed information about computer science and the many career 
                    opportunities fo computer scientists. <br><br>

                <div class="question">
                    What kind of background do I need to major in computer science?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    You need a strong analytical background including mathematics through intermediate algebra and trigonometry as well as the ability to think logically. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    I've had no computer programming in high school, will that be a problem?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    No, the introductory programming sequence starts from square one. No particular background is assumed. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    What programming languages will I learn?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    In your freshman year you will study Java. In upper level courses you will learn a variety of other languages such as C++, Scheme, and Perl. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    I've heard that computer science is a very difficult and time consuming major. Is that true?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Definitely, but the rewards are worth the effort. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    If I major in computer science, is it necessary that I buy a computer before I come to college?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Not at all. You may use any of the lab  computers at the college. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    If I wish to get a new computer, what should I get?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Stonehill College has partnered with CampusHP to create this program so that Stonehill College students can have a HP laptop that offers a standardized 
                    computing environment at very reasonable academic discount pricing. However, the department makes no specific recommendations. In fact, if you do not 
                    own a computer, you can use any of the machines in the public labs. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    If I major in computer science, can I do an internship in my junior or senior year?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Qualified upper classmen often do internships for credit. In fact, in recent years most students have done internship work. Typically, a student will 
                    work 10-12 hours per week on his/her internship and earn three semester hours of course credit.  Many of our students do internships at local companies 
                    such as General Dynamics, which is an easy  commute to Stonehill.  <br><br>

                <div class="question">
                    What are some of the companies where Stonehill alumni work?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Stonehill alumni have done very well on the job market. CS graduates have found jobs at Facebook, Microsoft, General Dynamics, IBM, EMC, RSA, Digital 
                    Research Group,  Intersystems, Fidelity, Northrup-Grumman, Abacus Software, Staples, and Putnam Investments to name a few. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Do many of your graduates attend graduate school?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Many of our students opt to attend graduate school directly after receiving a degree from Stonehill. Some of the schools which our graduates have 
                    attended are Brown, Duke, Dartmouth,  University of Virginia,  University of Maryland, Tufts University, University of Massachusetts, Boston University, 
                    The University of Texas, and University of Connecticut <br><br>

                <div class="question">
                    How big are the classes in computer science at Stonehill?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    The introductory classes have about 25 students. The upper level classes may have 10-20 students but may be as small as 4 or 5. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                    Will I have access to the internet and e-mail at Stonehill?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    All students have accounts with e-mail and wireless access to the Internet. <br><br>
                </div>
